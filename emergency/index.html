      <p class="profile__location"> Jason Davis is a peace advocate, author, poet, gang specialist, mental health
        advocate and father. Jason is also a credible messenger that travels around the world to educate society about
        the experiences of gang members and the consequences of communities that suffer from social isolation. Using his
        own narrative, he educates others about mental health awareness, addiction and self mutilation. His influence as
        a high ranking gang member has allowed him to assist communities to address gang related violence. He encourages
        future and current practitioners to become agents of change by becoming involved in community outreach and
        becoming more informed about mental illness. Currently he is the Family Engagement Specialist/Crisis
        Intervention Specialist for Living Redemption Youth Opportunity Hub in Harlem.
