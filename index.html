      Welcome to the Civil Servant locator created by members of Code Cooperative. The Civil Servant Locator app has
      been servicing the community since February 2020. This program came about from the constant need of help from your
      fellow people in your community. The idea of getting help and assistance in a matter of minutes was unheard of
      until now. The many issues that people currently go through, from physical conflict, to simple issues like getting
      help with making a resume. The civil servants are made of people just like you, they are relatable and also have
      expertise in their field. The idea of creating an app that connected people to help one another came about after
      my years of work as a direct service provider in marginal communities. I did this type work around the country and
      what I learned from it was that troubled youths were not the only people in need of help. I realized that we all
      need help or assistance at sometime in our lives. Attempting to become one step closer to bridging the gap of
      disconnection by connecting us through helping one another.
